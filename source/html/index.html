				<h3>Rescue</h3>
				<img class="mission-logos" src="assets/rescue_logo.jpg"/>
				<p>Our aim is to rescue abandoned and unwanted pets and place them into permanent, loving homes. Champaign County Pet Rescue is a no-kill shelter. We keep our pets until we have found them their forever homes.</p>

				<h3>Spay & Neuter</h3>
				<img class="mission-logos" src="assets/spay_logo.jpg"/>
				<p>We spay and neuter all of our animals which helps reduce the population of stray animals that can devastate local ecosystems and kill off populations of birds.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column-three">
				<h3>Adopt</h3>
				<img class="mission-logos" src="assets/adopt_logo.jpg"/>
				<p>All of our animals are waiting to go to their forever homes. There is a flat fee of $100 to adopt. No animal is unwanted. We hope that you can help make their dreams a reality.</p>

				<p>Meet the pretty little Jada!  Jada is a 2 year old female tuxedo kitty with a cute little face.  She had 6 adorable kittens which we named the Sesame Street kittens. She had Ernie, Oscar, Grover, Elmo, Cookie and Abby. All tuxedos like her or solid black. Abby is still available and the rest have all gone to their forever homes. Jada has been such a wonderful and protective Mom.  She is a very friendly and loving cat. Very very affectionate and loves to be around people.  She is also playful. We were playing with her kittens with the toys and she just jumped right in. She really is such an amazing cat and would love to find her forever home, too.</p>

				<p>Meet the very handsome and FUN loving Storm! Storm is a 2 year old solid gray boy with a fluffy tail. He has big green eyes and is absolutely adorable. Storm is a very friendly and sociable guy. He wants to be your friend instantly. He arrived from Louisiana in a transport van with other cats and dogs. And has really adapted very quickly to the shelter. He is still in his "kitty condo" until he acclimates more to the shelter and if you walk by he sticks his paw out to grab you. He loves people and we understand from the people that took care of him before us, he likes other cats and dogs, too. We are going to say no young children for him because he does like to play a little rough sometimes. He has a lot of personality and SASS!  And he loves to play, he was even entertaining himself. Storm is a fun cat that we think likes to be the center of attention.</p>

Weighs in at about 15 pounds so she is a little girl. She is a little on the shy side right now and naturally unsure of her new surroundings.  However she is friendly with us and is very sweet.  She likes other dogs and she would love to have her own home.  What a sweet and gentle little dog!</p>
